    <p>
        Hello! My name is <b>Sahil Chaudhari</b>. I am currently learning HTML 
        <i>from scratch</i> and enjoying it. I believe that understanding 
        the <u>basics</u> of web development is the foundation for building 
        creative projects.<br>
        Learning never stops, and every new concept feels like an exciting challenge!
    </p>


    <p>
        My hobbies include <i>reading books</i>, <u>playing games</u>, and 
        <mark>exploring new technologies</mark>. I also love experimenting 
        with coding projects and solving logical puzzles.<br>
        Apart from tech, I enjoy fitness activities and traveling.
    </p>

    
    <p>
        One of my biggest goals is to become a <b>full-stack developer</b> 
        in the next <sup>2</sup> years. I also want to contribute to 
        <sub>open-source</sub> projects and build applications that 
        can make life easier for people.<br>
        With dedication and consistency, I am confident I will achieve it.
