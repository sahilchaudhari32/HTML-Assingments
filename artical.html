  <h1>History of Computers and the Internet</h1>

  <h2>Early Computers</h2>
  <p>
    The story of computing starts with simple <b>mechanical</b> aids such as the abacus and continues through to
    complex machines. Inventors built <i>electromechanical</i> calculators and punched-card devices that automated
    repetitive tasks. Charles Babbage sketched the <u>Analytical Engine</u>, a design often called the
    <strong>first concept of a programmable computer</strong>, even though it was never completed in his lifetime.
    Ada Lovelace wrote what many consider the first algorithm and is often cited when historians use the word
    <em>programming</em> in its early sense. Early machines were large and slow, using gears and levers alongside
    experimental electrical components; historians often <mark>highlight</mark> their hybrid mechanical/electrical nature.
    These beginnings laid the groundwork for later, faster electronic designs.

  <h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
  <p>
    Computer historians divide development into generations — the 1st generation used <mark>vacuum tubes</mark>,
    the 2nd used <i>transistors</i>, and later generations moved to integrated circuits and microprocessors.
    The central component, the <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr>, evolved from discrete vacuum tubes to
    compact silicon chips. During the 3rd and 4th generations the rise of the <strong>microprocessor</strong> made
    <em>personal computing</em> possible and affordable for many people. By the 4th generation computers were smaller,
    faster, and more reliable; they began to fit on desks and eventually in pockets as smartphones and tablets.
    The transition included many replaced technologies — for example, older storage systems were <del>magnetic drums</del>
    and later replaced by <ins>solid-state drives</ins>. The trend toward miniaturization follows Moore's Law,
    often informally noted as transistors doubling roughly every two years (<var>n</var> → <var>2ⁿ</var> growth patterns).

  <h2>Mathematics, Logic &amp; Notation</h2>
  <p>
    Computers rest on mathematical and logical foundations that mathematicians formalized in the 19th and 20th centuries.
    Famous equations and notation occasionally appear in computer science writing — for example, Einstein's mass–energy
    relation <code>E = mc<sup>2</sup></code> is often used as a pedagogical example of <var>superscript</var> usage in HTML,
    and chemical notation like H<sub>2</sub>O shows <var>subscript</var> usage. In algorithms we may write recurrence relations
    such as T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n) to describe divide-and-conquer performance. Programmers use precise symbols and variables
    (for instance, <var>i</var>, <var>j</var>, <var>n</var>) when expressing loops and bounds. Early logic machines were
    inspired by Boolean algebra, where true/false logic maps to electrical on/off states. Even simple educational examples
    often mix text styles: a <b>bold</b> term for emphasis, <i>italics</i> for foreign words, and <u>underlining</u> for titles.
  </p>

  <h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
  <p>
    The networked era began with research projects that asked how to connect distant computers reliably across
    different networks. ARPANET showed packet-switching could work; later developments standardized protocols that
    allowed diverse systems to communicate. The <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>, created by Tim Berners-Lee,
    made the global network easy to navigate using hyperlinks and URLs; Tim once remarked that the Web's power is its
    universality and accessibility. A famous industry quote often referenced in articles is shown below in a blockquote.
    The combination of robust protocols (TCP/IP), client–server models, and higher-level application protocols
    produced an explosion of services, from email to file sharing and eventually streaming media.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    "The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect."
    — <cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Modern Era and Everyday Computing</h2>
  <p>
    Today computing is ubiquitous: devices range from servers in data centers to tiny embedded controllers.
    Where once we used <del>dial-up</del> connections, now we use <ins>broadband</ins> and fiber optics, and wireless
    networks carry most personal traffic. Many of us carry handheld computers that are orders of magnitude more powerful
    than machines used for the Apollo missions; these devices host apps, sensors, and always-on connectivity.
    The <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> that structures web pages uses many semantic tags — such as
    <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> — that separate meaning from presentation. When giving
    instructions we might show keyboard shortcuts: press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to copy or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>
    to paste; the system often responds with a status message like <samp>Text copied to clipboard.</samp>
    Small devices and wearables squeeze powerful features into <small>tiny form factors</small>, letting computing
    augment everyday life.
  </p>

  <h2>Computer Example &amp; Code Sample</h2>
  <p>
    Below is a short example of HTML that displays "Hello World" — shown in a code block so readers can copy it directly.
    The example uses structural tags and a <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> block to preserve whitespace and formatting.
    Educational documents often show code along with expected sample output enclosed by <samp> tags for clarity.
    For keyboard-driven operations, authors use <kbd> keys </kbd> to indicate what users should press in tutorials.
    Technical articles may also include inline quoted phrases like <q>store state</q> to indicate exact terms used in specs.
    When describing revisions we use <del>old text</del> and <ins>new text</ins> to make changes explicit.
  </p>

  <pre><code>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Hello World&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  </code></pre>

  <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
  <p>
    The history of computers and the Internet is a tapestry of ideas, inventions, standards, and human collaboration.
    From <b>mechanical calculators</b> to distributed cloud systems, each advance built on previous discoveries and
    sometimes unexpected reuse of old concepts. Scholars reference primary sources and papers using <cite>citations</cite>
    and quotes to credit original authors; primary texts remain important for understanding context and intent.
    Practical demonstrations — code snippets, keyboard instructions, and sample outputs — help learners connect theory
    to practice. As technology evolves, teaching the difference between visual formatting (<b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, <u>underline</u>)
    and semantic formatting (<strong>, <em>, <mark>) becomes more important for accessibility and maintainability.
    Readers should experiment with code, study protocols, and respect the history that led to today's connected world.
